# The Namegame

Thanks for the opportunity.  When I saw the application I thought of my 8-bit childhood and thought it would be cool to emulate an old game like contra.  
So I present my very minor exploration into late 80's 8-bit.  Since I was limited on time I only spent 9 hours on the project and thats a lot for trying to design 
and develop.  I spent only about 45 minutes on design (since this was a dev project) but would probably spend close to 8-10 hours if this were an actual paid project.
Please look through the files as I believe there are enough for you to see my work flow and how I code and design.  If you have any questions please don't 
hesitate to ask at zack@2721west.com.   Hope you have a wonderful week!

### To Start
1. Download Files
2. Run "npm install"
3. Run "bower install"
5. Run "gulp serve"

All remaining Gulp commands in gulpfile.js

### Notes
 - Because of time, only tested on Chrome Mac 47.0.2526.80
 - No testing was added
 - Probably could clean up structure but I wanted to spend under 8 hours so I took a earlier project I had built and revamped it. 
 - I added my design files to _design folder.  I used principal for the animation but if you don't have that I made an animated gif. 

### Still Todo (if I spent more time)
  [] Animations on the ngRepeat
  [] Key commands
  [] Look into storage on Local DB
  [] Deploy and Upload scripts for CDN storage
  [] Clean up some animations
  [] Add velocity.js to emulate the animations in the design gif. 
  [] More design iterations (I had a great idea about a Mario whack-a-mole)
  [] Sharing scores with social media
